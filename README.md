## Terraform providers
Terraform provider is a plugin responsible for managing API integrations and exposing cloud resources for automation.

Some sevice that Terraform support in ``IasS``

- IaaS: OCI, AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack 



## Terraform variables

Terraform variables allow to parameterize your configurations, making more dinamic and flexible. 
Varable declarations are typically placed in a file named variables.tf.

#### Variable delaclaration example:
Declare a vatiable vcn_cidr with a type string and default value.
```sh
variable "vcn_cidr" {
  type = "string"
  default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

#### Using variables:

Uses the variable in a resource configuration by referencing `var.<name>`
```sh
resource
"oci_core_virtual_network"
"MyVCN"{
cidr_block = var.vcn_cidr
(...)
}
```

#### Input Values
Pass values dynamically during the Terraform run using the -var flag.
```sh
terraform apply - 
var="vcn_cidr"=192.168.0.0/16"
```

# Conditional in Terraform
Conditionals in Terraform allow you make decisions dynamically within your configuration
This is particulary useful for resource creation, assing values, or enabling or disabling feature

### Conditional resource creation example:
In the next code show a terraform contional code, in this code the ``count`` evaluates the condition. If create_instances is true, the ``resource`` is created, otherwise, it is skipped.

```sh
variable "create_instance" {
        default = true
}

resource "oci_core_instance" "example" {
    count = var.create_instance ? 1 : 0
    display_name = "ExampleInstance"
    compartment_id = var.compartment_id
}

```
Note: Conditionals in terraform allow to make your configuration dynamic and efficient.
